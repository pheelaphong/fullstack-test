**1. Time Spent and Additional Features:**  
I spent approximately 3 hours developing the main project. If I had additional time, I would consider adding the following features:  
- A caching system to improve data retrieval performance  
- Authentication and authorization for the API  
- Dynamic display of detailed property information

**2. Security Best Practice:**  
I would validate and sanitize all user inputs and use Eloquent ORM's prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Additionally, implementing API rate limiting is essential to mitigate brute force attacks.

**3. Optimizing API Performance:**  
- Add indexes to frequently searched fields such as price, created_at, and geo (province)  
- Utilize caching (e.g., Redis) for queries that are executed frequently  
- Optimize and minimize queries to improve overall performance

**4. Tracking Performance Issues in Production:**  
To track performance issues, I would use monitoring and logging tools (such as Laravel Telescope, Sentry, or New Relic) to identify slow queries. Then, I would perform profiling and optimize the problematic queries. In a previous e-commerce project, I successfully improved performance by employing these tools and optimizing the queries.
